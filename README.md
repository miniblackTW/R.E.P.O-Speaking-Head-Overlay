# How to use
- Clone this repository
- Install dependencies - `pip install flask pyaudio`
- Run `python app.py` at the root folder of this project (**Python 3 required**), it will be running on localhost:25226
- To use this in OBS as overlay, you just have to add `http://localhost:25226` as **Browser Source** to OBS (From my experience, 300Ã—300 is just right)
